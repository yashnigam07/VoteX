# **Electronic Voting System (VoteX)**

## **Project Overview**

The **Electronic Voting System (VoteX)** is a secure and user-friendly application that allows users to vote for candidates in various positions. It includes an **admin mode** for viewing results and managing the voting process. The system also ensures security by restricting certain keys and providing a lock screen feature.

## **Features**

- **Voting System**: Enables voters to select candidates for multiple positions such as President, Vice President, Treasurer, etc.
- **Admin Mode**: Grants access to results and voting management via a secure password.
- **Security Features**: Restricts certain system keys (`Alt+F4`, `Win`, `Ctrl+Esc`) to prevent unauthorized interference.
- **Lock Screen**: Admins can lock the screen to ensure voting integrity.
- **CSV Storage**: Votes are securely stored in a CSV file for easy retrieval and management.
- **Anonymous Voting**: Voter anonymity is maintained through unique, anonymous IDs.
- **Audit Trails**: Logs all activities within the system to enhance transparency and security.

## **System Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `tkinter` (for GUI interface)
  - `keyboard` (to block/unblock keys)
  - `ctypes` (for locking the screen)
  - `csv` (for vote storage)

## **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/votex.git
   cd votex
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install tkinter keyboard
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```sh
   python voting_app.py
   ```

4. **CSV Data Storage**:
   - Votes are stored in `voting_data.csv`, automatically created upon the first vote submission.

## **Usage Guide**

- **Voting Process**: 
  - Voters enter their name, roll number, and select a voting duration.
  - They cast votes for candidates in different positions.
- **Admin Mode**: 
  - Access results and manage voting using the admin password (`admin123`).
  - Unlock restricted keys and exit fullscreen mode.
- **Lock Screen**: 
  - Admins can secure the application with a "Lock Screen" button to prevent tampering.

## **Security Measures**

- **Admin Authentication**: Only authorized admins can access results and modify settings.
- **Key Restrictions**: Disables critical system keys to prevent interruptions.
- **Encryption & Authentication** (Future Plan): Implementing cryptographic techniques for enhanced security.
- **Tamper-Evident Measures**: Strengthening the systemâ€™s integrity by tracking unauthorized modifications.

## **Comparison with Other Voting Systems**

| Feature           | VoteX (Offline) | Online Voting Systems |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Security**    | High (No network attacks) | Medium (Prone to cyber threats) |
| **Accessibility** | Limited (On-site voting) | High (Remote voting possible) |
| **Data Integrity** | High (Stored locally) | Medium (Network dependencies) |
| **Transparency** | High (Audit logs) | Varies (Depends on platform) |

## **Future Development Plans**

- **Enhanced Security Protocols**: Implementing **two-factor authentication** and **biometric verification**.
- **Audit Trail Expansion**: Strengthening tracking mechanisms for better accountability.
- **Web & Mobile Integration**: Exploring a hybrid system for broader accessibility.

## **Troubleshooting Guide**

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| App fails to start | Ensure Python 3.x and dependencies are installed. |
| CSV file not created | Check file path and user permissions. |
| Restricted keys not working | Verify that `keyboard` module is installed properly. |
